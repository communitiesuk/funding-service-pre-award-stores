# funding-service-pre-award

A repository for pre-award frontends and stores (apply, assess, authenticator).


## Setup

The recommended and supported way of running this service is using [the docker runner](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-docker-runner/). Please see that repository for instructions on running using `docker-compose`.

You will likely still want to create a local virtual environment for python dependencies, but you should only run the application using the provided docker-compose file.

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python versions and local virtual environments.

```bash
uv sync
```

To update requirements, use `uv add` or `uv remove`.

### Setup guide

[Developer setup guide](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-workflows/blob/main/readmes/python-repos-setup.md)

This service depends on:
- A postgres database

### IDE Setup
[Python IDE Setup](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-workflows/blob/main/readmes/python-repos-ide-setup.md)

### Setup pre-commit checks

* [Install pre-commit locally](https://pre-commit.com/#installation)
* Pre-commit hooks can either be installed using pip `pip install pre-commit` or homebrew (for Mac users) `brew install pre-commit`
* From your checkout directory run `pre-commit install` to set up the git hook scripts


## Data

### Local DB Setup
General instructions for local db development are available here: [Local database development](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-workflows/blob/main/readmes/python-repos-db-development.md)

## Updating database migrations

Whenever you make changes to database models, please run:

`uv run flask db migrate -m <message>`

The `message` should be a short description of the DB changes made. Don't specify a revision id (using `--rev-id`) - it will be generated automatically.

The migration file for your changes will be created in ./pre_award/db/migrations/versions. Please then commit and push these to github
so that the migrations will be run in the pipelines to correctly upgrade the deployed db instances with your changes.

## Builds and Deploys
Details on how our pipelines work and the release process is available [here](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/73695505/How+do+we+deploy+our+code+to+prod)

Paketo is used to build the docker image which gets deployed to our test and production environments. Details available [here](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-workflows/blob/main/readmes/python-repos-paketo.md)

### Copilot
Copilot is used for infrastructure deployment. Instructions are available [here](https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-workflows/blob/main/readmes/python-repos-copilot.md), with the following values for the fund store:
- service-name: fsd-pre-award

# Fund Store Specifics


## Seeding Fund Data
To seed fund & round data to db for all funds and rounds, use the fund/round loaders scripts.

If running against a local postgresql instance:
```bash
    python -m fund_store.scripts.load_all_fund_rounds
```

Further details on the fund/round loader scripts, and how to load data for a specific fund or round can be found [here](https://dluhcdigital.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FS/pages/40337455/Adding+or+updating+fund+and+round+data)

## Amending round dates
This script allows you to open/close rounds using their dates to test different functionality as needed. You can also use the keywords 'PAST', 'FUTURE' and 'UNCHANGED' to save typing dates.

```bash
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=pre-award") python -m fund_store.scripts.amend_round_dates -q update-round-dates --round_id c603d114-5364-4474-a0c4-c41cbf4d3bbd --application_deadline "2023-03-30 12:00:00"

docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=pre-award") python -m fund_store.scripts.amend_round_dates -q update-round-dates -r COF_R3W3 -o "2022-10-04 12:00:00" -d "2022-12-14 11:59:00" -ad "2023-03-30 12:00:00" -as NONE

docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=pre-award") python -m fund_store.scripts.amend_round_dates -q update-round-dates -r COF_R3W3 -o PAST -d FUTURE
```
For an interactive prompt where you can supply (or leave unchanged) all dates:
```bash
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=pre-award") python -m fund_store.scripts.amend_round_dates update-round-dates
```
To reset the dates for a round to those in the fund loader config:
```bash
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=pre-award") python -m fund_store.scripts.amend_round_dates -q reset-round-dates -r COF_R4W1
```
And with an interactive prompt:
```bash
docker exec -ti $(docker ps -qf "name=pre-award") python -m fund_store.scripts.amend_round_dates reset-round-dates
```

# Application Store Specifics


## Seeding Test Data
You can seed test data to use in the running application (separate to unit test data seeding). The seeding process needs a running fund-store to retrieve fund/round form section config, so it runs within the docker container for application-store within the docker runner.
To run the seeding script:
1. Make sure your local docker-runner is running
1. Find the container ID of `pre-award` by using `docker ps`
1. Use docker exec to get into that container: `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`
1. Execute the script: `python application_store/scripts/seed_db_test_data.py`. You will be prompted for inputs: fund, round, account_id (the UUID not email address), the status of the seeded applications and how many to create.

### Testing the seeding process
Unit tests exist in [test_seed_db](/tests/pre_award/application_store_tests/test_seed_db.py). They are marked as skipped as they require a running fund-store to retrieve form config (no point in duplicating this for tests) so they won't run in the pipeline but are fine locally. If your local fund store runs on a non-standard port etc, edit the `local_fund_store` fixture in that tests file. If you want to run the tests, just comment out the skip marker.

### Adding a new fund/round to the seeding process
To seed applicaitons, we need the completed form json. If you have that, skip to the end of part 1 and put that form json into the required file.

#### Part 1 - get the form json
1. Get a submitted application into your local DB. You can either do this manually or by running the automated tests against your local docker runner.
1. Find the `application_id` of that submitted application._
1. Edit the [tests file](/tests/pre_award/application_store_tests/test_seed_db.py) to un-skip `test_retrieve_test_data` and then set `target_app` to be the `application_id` you just submitted.
1. Update your unit test config to point at the same DB as the docker runner. Update [pytest.ini](/pytest.ini) so that `D:DATABASE_URL` points at the docker runner application store db: `D:DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:5433/application_store  # pragma: allowlist secret`
1. Run the single test `test_retrieve_test_data` - this should output the json of all the completed forms for that application into funding-service-design-store/forms.json.
1. Copy this file into [seed_data](/tests/pre_award/application_store_tests/seed_data/) and name it `<fund_short_code>_<round_short_code>_all_forms.json`.
1. *IMPORTANT* Change the config in [pytest.ini](/pytest.ini) back to what it was so you don't accidentally wipe your docker runner DB next time you run tests!

#### Part 2 - update seeding config
1. In [seed_db](/tests/pre_award/application_store_tests/seed_data/seed_db.py) there is a constant called `FUND_CONFIG` - update this following the existing structure for your new fund/round (if it's a new round on an existing fund, just add it as another key to `rounds` item in that fund). You will need to know the name of the form that contains the field used to the name the application/project.
1. In the same file, update the `click.option` choice values for fund/round as required, to allow your new options.
1. Test it - update the unit tests to use this new config and check it works.


# Assessment Store Specifics

# Testing
## Import submitted applications from application_store
To import the submitted applications of a round into assessment, execute the below command.

    docker exec -it <container_id> python -m scripts.import_from_application --roundid=c603d114-5364-4474-a0c4-c41cbf4d3bbd --app_type=COF
or with short name

    docker exec -it <container_id> python -m scripts.import_from_application --fundround=COFR3W1

If using VsCode, select the launch config "[Import Applications to Assessment](#launch-config-vscode)" to import the application.


## Seed Postgres DB with mock data

`invoke seed_dev_db`

Running the above command will prompt you to enter the number of applications, funds & rounds you would like to create as mock data within the database.

This will also work for the DB within the docker runner. Find the ID of the docker container running assessment-store (`docker ps`) then execute:

        docker exec -it <container_id> invoke seed_dev_db

To avoid the interactive prompt, alternatively the fund-round and application count can be provided as arguments
such as:

        invoke seed_dev_db --fundround COFR2W2 --appcount 1

If using VsCode, select the launch config "[Seed Applications in assessment-store](#launch-config-vscode)" to start seeding.


## Transactional tests

Test data is created on a per-test basis to prevent test pollution. To create test data for a test, request the `seed_application_records` fixture in your test. That fixture then provides access to the inserted records and will clean up after itself at the end of the test session.

More details on the fixtures in utils: https://github.com/communitiesuk/funding-service-design-utils/blob/dcc64b0b253a1056ce99e8fe7ea8530406355c96/README.md#fixtures

Basic example:

    @pytest.mark.apps_to_insert(
        [
            {
                # Assessment_Records data
                # For convencience a set of these are loaded into the variable test_input_data in conftest.py
                test_input_data[0]
            }
        ]
    )
    def test_stuff(seed_application_records):
      app_id = seed_application_records[0].id
      # do some testing

## Flags
If you need your test assessment records to be flagged, you can supply flag config as part of the apps_to_insert data by including
an array of flag configs under the property `flags`. Some example flag configs are contained in test_data/flags.py


    @pytest.mark.apps_to_insert(
        [
            test_input_data[0],
            {**test_input_data[1], "flags": [flag_config[2]]},
            {**test_input_data[2], "flags": [flag_config[1]]},
        ]
    )
    def test_stuff(seed_application_records):
        flag = retrieve_flag_for_application(seed_application_records[1].id)
        assert flag == flag_config[2]

## Unique Fund and Round IDs - same for all applications
If you need all your test data to use the same fund and round ids, but be different from all other tests, use `unique_fund_round` in your test. This generates a random ID for fund and round and uses this when creating test applications.

    pytest.mark.apps_to_insert([test_input_data[0]])
    @pytest.mark.unique_fund_round(True)
    def test_some_reports(
        seed_application_records
    ):
        result = get_by_fund_round(
            fund_id=seed_application_records[0]["fund_id"], round_id=seed_application_records[0]["round_id"]
        )



## Testing FAQS

### Q: help! My tests are failing because of `no rows found`
You've deleted your unit test db or done something manually, so pytest's cache is confused.
Run `pytest --cache-clear` to fix your problem.
